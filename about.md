I’m a geek who learned, around 10 years ago, to program trying to create a fun non-official Ultima Online server. This “adventure” showed me my passion: software development. 

Not long after that, I started working as a software developer and I’ve been doing this since then, dealing mainly with the .NET plataform, JavaScript and Ruby/Rails, but I’ve already made some stuff with C++, Python and Java. I usually work with the whole stack of development (back and front-end), but I enjoy working more with backend infrastructure. Despite being more experienced with some technologies I'm already used to learn very fast and adapt myself to work with anything related to programming.

Nowadays I’m a senior consultant at a Brazilian company called Lambda3. We develop software for startups, give development and agile courses and give assistance to other companies with specialized consulting. I try to help with every aspect of the company, however my main responsibility is to develop software for our customers and help other developers to improve themselves.

On my personal side I spend most of my time studying code design, programming languages (mainly C++ now) and algorithms, but I’ve been also focusing on improving my English and learning Swedish.

You can ask: why Swedish? It’s easy: I want to live in Sweden! So if you’re from there and/or know someone who is looking for a great developer, or if you can help me with that, send me an e-mail: <arias.sp@gmail.com>. I’d be very pleased :-)
