#Hi!

I’m a geek who learned, around 10 years ago, to program trying to create a fun non-official Ultima Online server. This “adventure” showed me my passion: software development. 

Not long after that, I started working as a software developer and I’ve being doing this since then, dealing mainly with the .NET plataform, JavaScript and Ruby/Rails, but I’ve already made some stuff with C++, Python and Java. I usually work with the whole stack of development (back and front-end), but I enjoy working more with backend infrastructure.

Nowadays I’m a senior consultant at a Brazilian company called Lambda3. We develop software for startups, give development and agile courses and give assistance to other companies with specialized consulting. I try to help with every aspect of the company, however my main responsibility is to develop software projects and help other developers to make some improvement.

On my personal side I spend most of my time studying code design, programming languages (mainly C++ now) and algorithms, but I’ve been also focusing on improving my English and learning Swedish.

You can ask: why Swedish? It’s easy: I want to live in Sweden! So if you’re from there and/or know someone who is looking for a great developer, or if you can help me with that, send me an e-mail: <arias.sp@gmail.com>. I’d be very pleased and glad :-)
