title: Hi!

I'm a multidisciplinary software developer from Brazil, passionate about coding both back and front-end stuff with Ruby, Javascript, Java, C++, C#, Scala or whatever is necessary.

Oh! Besides programming I'm also studying Swedish. You can ask: why Swedish? It’s easy: I want to live in Sweden! So if you’re from there and/or know someone who is looking for a great developer, or if you can help me with that, send me an e-mail: <arias.sp@gmail.com>. I’d be very pleased :-)
