title: Hi!
---

I'm a multidisciplinary software developer, passionate about coding both back and front-end stuff with Ruby, Javascript, C++, Java, C#, Scala, Elixir, Erlang or whatever is necessary.

Oh! Besides programming I'm also studying Swedish. You can ask: why Swedish? It’s easy: I'm moving to Sweden on 2013-11-8! I'll continue working remotely to my current employee, but I'll be looking for a gig in Stockholm. If you are from Stockholm and are looking for a software developer, or if you know someone who is, send me an e-mail: <arias.sp@gmail.com>. I’d be very pleased :-)

PS: My current employee knows that I'm looking for something in Stockholm/Sweden and even support me doing that, so please don't think I'm acting behind their back!
